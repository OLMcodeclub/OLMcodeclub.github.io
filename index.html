        <h1>Week 1 at OLM Code Club <small>30/9/16</small></h1>

        <h3>What do we do at Code Club? </h3>
        <p>We will be making animations, games, websites, and much more. Code Club is all about using computers to help us make cool stuff. A key thing you will learn is how to program computers to make them follow your instructions.</p>

        <p>We will be sharing our examples from code club on our <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3456235/">Studio</a>. This is important because a great way to learn is to look at how other people have solved problems that you may be trying to work out. For example, how do I make a spaceship look like it has blown up? TIP FOR THE DAY: we are going to be "pair programming" since it is fun to work together and two heads can usually solve problems better than one!</p>
      
        <h3>Club Rules</h3>
        <p>What?! You have <a href="/docs/02-CodeClub_rules.pptx">rules?</a></p>
      
        <h3>What will we be doing?</h3>
        <p>In term one we will be covering:
          <ul>
            <li>Scratch Module 1 - 6 great games to cover the basics of what you need to know to make your own game, animation, adventure story etc.</li>
            <li>Scratch Module 2 - 6 more challenges which end in you making your own game</li>
            <li>BBC Micro:bit - we will be getting 8 of these fantastic kits some time after half term - watch this space...</li>
            <li>A Christmas special - what will we make this year?</li>
          </ul>

         </p>
         <p>For the experienced Code Clubber you can join in with the above (note there are some new scratch challenges on the Code Club website) or you can:
          <ul>
            <li>Try the new Python Module - it is ace!</li>
            <li>Build a website for Code Club (or maybe your own blog or web design business)</li>
            <li>Create your own project using a makey makey, or use arduino to flash some lights, or program some robots, or make models for 3D printing...</li>
          </ul>
         </p>
      
         <h3>What's next?</h3>
         <p>Log in to Scratch (we will help) and make sure your name is on the activity log. Experienced Code Clubbers, can you be ready to say at the end of todays club a little description of what you plan to work on this term.</p>


         <h1>Welcome to OLM Code Club Pages <small>26/9/16</small></h1>

         <p>Over the course of 2016/2017 term we will be uploading examples of our work here. We have been running since 2013 thanks to a number of parent volunteers helping out. Previous work was <a href="http://olmcodeclub.pancakeapps.com/">more recently here</a> and <a href="http://olmcodeclub.pancakeapps.com/index_2014.html">in 2014 here</a>.</p>
